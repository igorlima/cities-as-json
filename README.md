# Cities as JSON

All used data is available on Correios, Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

## Is there any methods that I can use?

No. It is pure JSON and I have no intention to develop methods to manipulate this data.

## JSON Schema

Following the KISS statements, it it simple as possible, the basic schema is below.

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Acre",
    "cities": [
      {"description": "Rio Branco"}
    ]
  }
]
```

## I cannot find some cities

Just open an issue and I'll fix.
